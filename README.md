# MartyrsDataStructure

this is an implementaion for an application to store palestinian martyrs records.
This system contains many martyrs. Each martyr have a record contains its name, gender, location of birth and more information.
To achive this system, I've used my enhanced data structures such as Stacks, Queues, LinkedLists (Single and Double) and Trees

Here are some screenshots from the system:
